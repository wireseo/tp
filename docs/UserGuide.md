## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Introduction
Jarvis is a desktop app for CS1101S Teaching Assistants (Avengers), optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Jarvis in general helps to organise and simplify
CS1101S tutors' administrative tasks.

### 1.2 Purpose
As an Avenger, not only do you have immense power but you are also burdened with inevitable great responsibility.
Not to worry, Jarvis is here to empower you to manage your personal tasks while teaching others efficiently and
effectively.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. About the User Guide
This section aims to remind you of the important parts to take note of while reading the user guide.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Quick start
(Everyone)

1. Ensure you have Java 11 or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest _jarvis.jar_ and your operating system's _Chrome Driver_ from [here](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-W11-2/tp/releases/tag/v1.3).
It is crucial to have the Chrome Driver in order for Jarvis to start up, if the GUI does not launch,
Please check that you have installed the correct driver
    1. Windows: chromedriver.exe
    1. MacOS: chromedriver_mac
    1. Linux: chromedriver_linux

1. Copy both files to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your Jarvis.

1. There are two options for launching Jarvis.
    1. Double-click the `jarvis.jar` file to start the app.
    1. Launch Jarvis from the the Windows Command Prompt or MacOS
    command line by navigating to the directory containing jarvis.jar,
    then typing the command `java -jar jarvis.jar`

    A GUI similar to the screenshot below should appear in a few seconds.

   ![Jarvis](images/userguide/Jarvis.png)

1. Upon start up, you will be prompted to log in to unlock Jarvis's
 full set of features.
 Please refer to the logging in segment below to complete your log in.

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing help and pressing Enter will open the help window.
   Some example commands you can try:
   * `view -s:  Lists all students. `
   * `view -s John Doe: Lists information about a student named John Doe.`
   * `add -t DESCRIPTION : Adds a todo task with specified description.`
   * `edit -t TASK_ID : Marks the task referenced by Task_ID as Done.`
   * `exit : Exits the app.`

1. Refer to the Features below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Navigating Jarvis
(Everyone)

Jarvis has a Graphical User Interface centered around a command input box on the top, surrounded by a light green
line. The green box below the command input box is the user feedback box. Jarvis provides feedback to the user through
this box.

### 4.1 UI Layout
(Everyone)
<br>
   * The user interface is split into clearly marked tabs: `Student`, `Mission`, `Quest`, `Consultation`, `Mastery Check`, `Task`.
<br>
   * Clicking on each tab will give you the information you require for that field.

![Jarvis](images/userguide/Jarvis.png)

The core features are based on Students, Missions, Quests, Consultations, Mastery Checks and Tasks.
Each core feature has a tab for the organisation of its information.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

To navigate the features, there are 2 methods which could be used individually, or mixed. We have designed
this flexibility with you, the user in mind.
 1. Only inputting commands into the box annotated "Enter command here..".
 1. Clicking on the tabs.
</div>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Logging into Jarvis

The following is the prompt upon first log in, you are prompted to key in your Sourceacademy username and password:

![NoLoginDetails](images/userguide/loginPrompt.png)

To log in, simply edit your log in details with the following command:
<br>**Format: `edit -l u/LUMINUS_USERNAME p/LUMINUS_PASSWORD`**
<br>Examples:
* `edit -l u/nusstu\e1234567 p/testpassword`

An example of the command being inputted:

![LoginUsernamePasswordInput](images/userguide/editLoginDetails.png)

Within the green rectangle box, Jarvis will notify you if the log in was successful. Upon success, all information from
 sourceacademy will be visible
 to you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6. Features

### 6.1 General Notes about Command Format

   * Words in UPPER_CASE are the parameters to be supplied by you.
   <br> e.g. in `add -t DESCRIPTION`, `DESCRIPTION` is a parameter which can be used as `add -t Mark Missions`.

   * Items in square brackets are optional.
   <br> e.g `view -s [NAME]`, name is an optional parameter. It can be used as `view -s` or as `view -s [John]`.

   * Parameters can be in any order.
   <br> e.g. if the command specifies `t/TELEGRAM e/EMAIL`, `e/EMAIL t/TELEGRAM` is also acceptable.

   * Commands with arrows indicate a multi-step process.
   <br> e.g. `delete -c → 1` means that you should enter `delete -c` first and then `1` after the prompt
   has been processed.

**Notes about Jarvis' relationship with Sourceacademy:** (Peirong) <br>
* Students’ names that are under the Avenger will be fetched automatically from sourceacademy.nus.edu.sg upon startup.
* Luminus username and passwords will be stored in plaintext.

### 6.2 Viewing help : `help`

Shows a message explaining how to access the help page.
<br>**Format: `help`**

### 6.3 Adding Information : `add`

#### General Notes on Tasks

Each `Task` you create, be it `Todo`, `Event` or `Deadline`, there will be an unique ID assigned to each of them, so
that there will be no 2 of the same Task ID in your Task List at any point of Time. The Task ID is reflected as
<br>eg. D1, E5, T21
The first alphabet "T", "E" and "D" refers to `Todo`, `Event`, and `Deadline` respectively, and the number followed
after the alphabet is the Task Number, which refers to the index of the `Task` you created with respect to all the
`Task` you ever created.

#### 6.3.1 Adding Todos `-t`

Adds your personal `Todo` with a `description`.

![AddTodo](images/userguide/addTodo.png)

<br>**Format: `add -t DESCRIPTION`**
<br>Examples:
* `add -t Clear the bin`
* `add -t Return calculator to Mary`

#### 6.3.2 Adding Events : `-e`

Adds your personal `Event` with a `description`, to attend at a specific `date` and `time`.

![AddEvent](images/userguide/addEvent.png)

<br>**Format: `add -e DESCRIPTION d/YYYY-MM-DD t/HH:MM`**
<br>Examples:
* `add -e John’s birthday party d/2020-09-21 t/20:00`
* `add -e CS2103T team meeting d/2020-09-27 t/10:30`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

An `Event` requires extra `date` and `time` specifications in order to create.
</div>

#### 6.3.3 Adding Deadlines : `-d`

Adds your personal `Deadline` with a `description`, to complete by a specific `date` and `time`.

![AddDeadline](images/userguide/addDeadline.png)

<br>**Format: `add -d DESCRIPTION d/YYYY-MM-DD t/HH:MM`**
<br>Examples:
* `add -d CS2103T Week 5 ip tasks d/2020-09-08 t/23:59`
* `add -d Research project report d/2020-10-05 t/10:30`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

</div>

#### 6.3.4 Adding Consultations : `-c`

Adds a `Consultation` session with a `Student` at a specific `date` and `time`.
<br>**Format: `add -c NAME d/YYYY-MM-DD t/HH:MM`**
<br>Examples:
* `add -c John Doe d/2020-09-20 t/13:30`
* `add -c Mary Jane d/2021-01-02 t/09:15`

#### 6.3.5 Adding Mastery Checks : `-mc`

<br>Examples:
* `add -mc John Doe d/2020-09-20 t/13:30`
* `add -mc Mary Jane d/2021-01-02 t/09:15`

### 6.4 Editing Information : `edit`

#### 6.4.1 Editing Login Information : `-l`

Similar to the format for editing students above, you can use tags to specify the field to be edited.
<br>**Format: `edit -l u/LUMINUS_USERNAME p/LUMINUS_PASSWORD`**
<br>Examples:
* `edit -l u/nusstu\e1234567 p/testpassword`
* `edit -l p/testpassword`

<br>Notes:
* Do note that it takes a load time of around ~5 seconds after entering this command for the changes from Sourceacademy to be reflected in the GUI.
* After the students, missions and quests have loaded, take note that the `Telegram` and `Email` fields of the student are placeholder values.
* This is because SA does not contain these 2 fields of any student. Editing the student details will save the updated values. 

#### 6.4.2 Editing Student Information : `-s`
<br>**Format: `edit -s INDEX n/NAME t/TELEGRAM e/EMAIL`**

<br>**Format: `edit -mc INDEX s/SCORE`**
<br>Examples:
* `edit -s 1 s/0`
* `edit -s 3 s/1`

Do note that the SCORE parameter can only be 0 or 1, according to the actual restrictions of mastery check pass/fail in CS1101S.

<br>**Format: `delete -c`**
<br>Examples:
* `delete -c
   → 3`

#### 6.5.3 Deleting Mastery Checks : `-mc`

Similar to the above process of deleting consultations, deleting `Mastery Checks` first
shows a list of `Mastery Checks` with `id numbers` so that you can specify which session you want to delete.

<br>Examples:
* `delete -mc → 3`

### 6.6 Viewing Information : `view`

Mastery Checks are a specific type of consultations that is mandatory and graded in CS1101S, unlike normal consultations, and thus are displayed in separate tabs in Jarvis.


## 9. FAQ

`Q: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?`
<br>`A: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file(.txt file) it creates with the file(.txt file) that contains the data of your previous JARVIS home folder.`
